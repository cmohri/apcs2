HW48 — Heap o’ Trouble
2018-05-14

For the adding algorithms, add the element to the end of the array and "walk it up" the tree until it is its correct location.
Remember, a parent's index will always be (i/2) where i is the child's index.

Add Min-Heap (min value at root)

1. Add element addedValue to end of array.
2. If addedValue is less than parent (index of i/2), swap addedValue and parent. Go to step 2.
3. Else addedValue is in its correct location.

Add Max-Heap (max value at root)

1. Add element addedValue to end of array.
2. If addedValue is greater than parent, swap addedValue and parent. Go to step 2.
3. Else addedValue is in its correct location.

Remove Min-Heap (min value at root)

1. Remove element from array. Record removed element's index i.
2. Check which child is smaller, move said child to i, set i to said child's old index.
3. Repeat step 2 until child is null.

Remove Max-Heap (max value at root)

1. Remove element from array. Record removed element’s index i.
2. Check which child is greater, move said child to i, set i to said child’s old index.
3. Repeat step 2 until child is null.
