My most riveting adventure with my duckie last year is when we had to find out how to graph points on a two dimensional array if we had the typical (x, y) coordinates and an xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax for the graph. By discussing it over with my duck in front of a valuable KtS, we were able to find the solution.
